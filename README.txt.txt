In this weeks homework, i was a bit confused by the instructions. However the changes i made were as follows;
- Changed the coding structure to be easier to read for anyone looking at it.
- Added Alt tags to images
- Changed all 'Div' classes to Sections/headers/Etc
- Added comments to lines of codes to help others follow

I am unsure if this was the task that was required, however i hope to hear back.
